Omnivox Auto Login
-----
Chrome extension

Keep logged in on Omnivox.

This script will save your username and password when you first manually log in. After that, it will fill the login form and submit for you automatically. It also attempts to keep you always logged in by submitting the form on the background every 10 minutes.

#### How to use:
1. Go to Omnivox login page
2. Fill username and password, then log in manually
3. From then, the extension will automatically log in for you :)


**Never use this script on shared machines!**

The password is stored and submitted (with HTTPS) in plain text, so I recommend you to use a dedicated password for Omnivox.
This extension doesn't communicate with anything except Omnivox.


Enjoy :)
