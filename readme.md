Omnivox Auto Login
-----
Chrome extension

Keep logged in on Omnivox.

This script will save your username and password when you first manually log in. After that, it will fill the login form and submit for you automatically. It also attempts to keep you always logged in by submitting the form on the background every 10 minutes.


**It will only work once you logged in manually on Omnivox!**   
**Never use this script on shared machines!**

The password is stored and submitted (with HTTPS) in plain text so I recommend you to use a dedicated password for Omnivox.


Enjoy :)
